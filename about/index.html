		The Omphalos is a website dedicated to both aspiring and professional <br> 
		photographers all around the world. Here, different photographers are <br>
		featured each week, and each photographer brings their own style to the website. <br>
		At the Omphalos, we are ever inspired by the creative endeavours that are taken by <br>
		these incredibly talented photographers. We hope that by providing a serene <br>
		environment like the Omphalos, others are also encouraged to pursue and <br>
		achieve their artistic goals.<br>
		<br>
		The Omphalos was originally started in 2011 as a Greek photo blog by Aaron <br>
		Walter (hence, the Greek title, "Omphalos"). Since then, it has expanded to include <br>
		a wide array of different photos displaying culture, aesthetic, and creativity from <br>
		everywhere in the world. The photographers featured each week come from a variety of <br>
		unique backgrounds and cultures, and all add to the diverse community that is the Omphalos.<br>
		<br>
		Here at the Omphalos, our goal is to provide as many people as possible with the <br>
		inspiration and motivation to challenge themselves creatively. In a world that is <br>
		often dominated by the hustle and bustle of busy schedules and never-ending errands, <br>
		we want to provide those who wish to study the arts a beginning place to do so. <br>
		Every year, we provide over two hundred scholarships for those entering post <br>
		-secondary education seeking a degree in art. All this is possible only with the <br>
		generous donations and help from sponsors, and you. <br>
		<br>
		We hope you enjoy your time here at the Omphalos!
