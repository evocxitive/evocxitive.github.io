		<p id="poem" class = "pullquote">
			Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
			And, in parting from you now,<br>
			Thus much let me avow --<br>
			You are not wrong, who deem<br>
			That my days have been a dream;<br>
			Yet if hope has flown away<br>
			In a night, or in a day,<br>
			In a vision, or in none,<br>
			Is it therefore the less gone?<br>
			All that we see or seem<br>
			Is but a dream within a dream.<br>
			<br>
			I stand amid the roar<br>
			Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
			And I hold within my hand<br>
			Grains of the golden sand --<br>
			How few! yet how they creep<br>
			Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
			While I weep -- while I weep!<br>
			O God! can I not grasp<br>
			Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
			O God! can I not save<br>
			One from the pitiless wave?<br>
			Is all that we see or seem<br>
			But a dream within a dream?<br>
