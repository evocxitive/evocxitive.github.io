		<h3>bringing strong images, memories, or feelings to mind.</h3>
		<p> Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
			that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
			people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
			because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
			Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
			drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
			have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
			nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
			spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
			neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
			opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</p>
